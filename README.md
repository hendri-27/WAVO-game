# WAVO-game
WAVO (Walk Avoid Obstacle) game is a simple arcade game that I made using Visual Studio 2019. The purpose of making this game is for understanding concept in c# language. This game was made on 2019 by myself. 

The objective of this game is to avoid all car and keep alive until all heart is gone. At the end of the game, you will get time for how long you could survive and also until which level you're alive.

This project is just made for fun only. :D

here is some teaser about the layout of the game.
